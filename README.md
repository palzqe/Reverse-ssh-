Reverse SSH tunneling is a technique that allows you to establish a secure connection from a remote server or device back to a local machine, even if the local machine is behind a firewall or NAT (Network Address Translation).
This is particularly useful when you need to access a local machine that doesn't have a public IP address or is otherwise unreachable from the internet.
